A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A "complete" computer including the hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a computer system. This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster.
Computers are used as control systems for a wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer-aided design, and also general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects hundreds of millions of other computers and their users.
Early computers were only conceived as calculating devices. Since ancient times, simple manual devices like the abacus aided people in doing calculations. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century. The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II. The first semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with MOS transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the Digital Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.
Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU) in the form of a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) microprocessor, along with some type of computer memory, typically MOS semiconductor memory chips. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information. Peripheral devices include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the 2000s-era touchscreen). Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of operations to be saved and retrieved.

<h2>Computer system</h2>
<p>
<strong>Definition:</strong>Is a collection of entities(hardware,software and liveware) that are designed to receive, process, manage and present information in a meaningful format.
</p>
<h3>Components of computer system</h3>
<ul class="unorderedList">
<li><strong>Computer hardware</strong> - Are physical parts/ intangible parts of a computer. eg Input devices, output devices, central processing unit and storage devices</li>
<li><strong>Computer software</strong> - also known as programs or applications. They are classified into two classes namely - sytem software and application software</li>
<li><strong>Liveware</strong> - is the computer user. Also kwon as orgwareor the humanware. The user commands the computer system to execute on instructions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>a) Computer hardware</h3>
<p>
<img class="rightPic computer" src="Overview/Computer.jpg">
Hardware refers to the physical, tangible computer equipment and devices, which provide support for major functions such as input, processing (internal storage, computation and control), output, secondary storage (for data and programs), and communication.
</p>
<h3>Hardware categories (Functional Parts)</h3>
<p>
A computer system is a set of integrated devices that input, output, process, and store data and information. Computer systems are currently built around at least one digital processing device. There are five main hardware components in a computer system: Input, Processing, Storage, Output and Communication devices.
</p>
<h3><span style="padding-left:10px"> <strong>1.Input devices</strong></span></h3>
<p>
Are devices used for entering data or instructions to the central processing unit. Are classifie according to the method they use to enter data.
</p>
<strong>
<h3>a) Keying devices</br></h3>
Are devices used to enter data into the computer using a set of Keys eg Keyboard, key-to- storage and keypad.
</strong>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3><strong>i) The keyboard</strong></h3>
<p>
Keyboard (similar to a typewriter) is the main input device of a computer . It contains three types of keys-- alphanumeric keys, special keys and function keys. Alphanumeric keys are used to type all alphabets, numbers and special symbols like $, %, @, A etc. Special keys such as <Shift>, <Ctrl>, <Alt>, <Home>, <Scroll Lock> etc. are used for special functions. Function keys such as <Fl>, <F2>, <F3> etc. are used to give special commands depending upon the software used e.g.F5 reloads a page of an internet browser. The function of each and every key can be well understood only after working on a PC. When any key is pressed, an electronic signal is produced. This signal is detected by a keyboard encoder that sends a binary code corresponding to the key pressed to the CPU. There are many types of keyboards but 101 keys keyboard is the most popular one.
</p>
<strong>
<h3>b) Pointing devices</br></h3>
Are devices that enter data and instructions into the computer using a pointer that appears on the screen. The items to be entered are selected by either pointing to or clicking on them.e.g mice, joystick, touch sensitive screen, trackballs
</strong>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3><strong>i) The mouse</strong></h3>
<p>
<img class="rightPic mouse" src="Overview/Mouse.jpg"/>
A mouse is a small device used to point to and select items on your computer screen. Although mice come in many shapes, the typical mouse does look a bit like an actual mouse. It's small, oblong, and connected to the system unit by a long wire that resembles a tail and the connector which can either be PS/2 or USB. Some newer mice are wireless.
</br>
</br>
A mouse usually has two buttons: a primary button (usually the left button) and a secondary button. Many mice also have a wheel between the two buttons, which allows you to scroll smoothly through screens of information.
</br>
</br>
When you move the mouse with your hand, a pointer on your screen moves in the same direction. (The pointer's appearance might change depending on where it's positioned on your screen.) When you want to select an item, you point to the item and then click (press and release) the primary button. Pointing and clicking with your mouse is the main way to interact with your computer. There are several types of mice: Mechanical mouse, optical mouse, optical-mechanical mouse and laser mouse.
</p>
<strong>
<h3>c) Scanning devices</br></h3>
Are devices that capture an object or a document directly from the source. They are classifie according to the technology used to capture data e.g. Scanners and Document readers.
</strong>
<h3><strong>i) Scanners</strong></h3>
<p>
<img class="leftPic computer" src="Overview/Scanner.png"/>
Used to capture a source document and converts it into an electronic form.
Example are - FlatBed and HandHeld scanners.

<h3><strong>ii) Document readers</strong></h3>
<p>Are documents that reads data directly from source document and convey them as input in the form of electronic signal. e
Types of Document Readers</p>
<ol style="padding-left:50px ">
<li> Optical Mark Reader (OMR)</li>
<li> Barcode readers</li>
<li>Optical Character Readers</li>
<li>Magnetic Readers</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Central processing unit(CPU)</strong></h3>
<p>
Is the brain or the heart of a computer. Is also known as processor and consist of three units namely -
</p>
<ol style="padding-left:50px;">
<li>Control Unit(CU)</li>
<li>Arithmetic logic Unit(ALU)</li>
<li>Memory Unit</li>
</ol>
<img class="middlePic" src="Overview/BlockDiagram.jpg"/>
<h4><strong>Functions of central processing unit</strong></h4>
<p>
- Process data</br>
- Control sequence of operaions within the computers</br>
- It gives command to all parts of a computer</br>
- It control the use of the main memory in storing of data and instructions</br>
- it provides temporary storage (RAM) and permanent storage(ROM) of data</br>
</p>
<p>
The system unit is the core of a computer system. Usually it's a rectangular box placed on or underneath your desk. Inside this box are many electronic components that process data. The most important of these components is the central processing unit (CPU), or microprocessor, which acts as the "brain" of your computer. Another component is random access memory (RAM), which temporarily stores information that the CPU uses while the computer is on. The information stored in RAM is erased when the computer is turned off.
</br>
</br>
Almost every other part of your computer connects to the system unit using cables. The cables plug into specific ports (openings), typically on the back of the system unit. Hardware that is not part of the system unit is sometimes called a peripheral device. Peripheral devices can be external such as a mouse, keyboard, printer, monitor, external Zip drive or scanner or internal, such as a CD-ROM drive, CD-R drive or internal modem. Internal peripheral devices are often referred to as integrated peripherals. There are two types according to shape: tower and desktop.
</p>
<h3><strong>Motherboard</strong></h3>
<p>
<img class="rightPic motherboard" src="Overview/Motherboard.jpg"/>
A motherboard (mainboard, system board, planar board or logic board) is the main printed circuit board found in computers and other expandable systems. It holds many of the crucial electronic components of the system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals.
